# System Usage Analysis

This project analyzes system CPU and RAM usage over time using Python.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- psutil

## Project Overview
- Collected real-time CPU and RAM usage data
- Stored time-series data in CSV format
- Analyzed usage patterns and stability
- Visualized system performance trends

## Key Insights
- CPU usage fluctuated at low levels with one brief spike
- RAM usage remained largely stable throughout the session
- Overall system performance was normal with no sustained high load

## Files
- `collector.py` – Collects system usage data
- `analysis.ipynb` – Data analysis and visualization
- `INSIGHTS.md` – Observations and conclusions
- `data/` – Raw collected data
- `plots/` – Generated graphs
