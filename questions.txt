SYSTEM USAGE ANALYSIS – NOTES

Q1. What is the average CPU and RAM usage?
Answer:The average cpu is at 3% and the average ram usage is at 45%

Q2. When did the highest CPU usage occur?
Answer: The highest cpu usage occured at around "14:15:10" at 29%.
        timestamp    2025-12-28 14:15:10
        cpu_usage                     29
        ram_usage                     46
        Name: 61, dtype: object

Q3. Was CPU usage stable or variable?
Answer:No the cpu was stable enough and the highest spike was at 29%.
        Analysis: Matplotlib line chart

Q4. Did RAM usage change significantly?
Answer:No the ram usage didnt change significantly, RAM usage was very stable.
    Analysis: Matplotlib line chart

Q5. What pattern does the CPU usage graph show?
Answer:The graph shows that the cpu usage was not stable and had several spikes and highest at 29% and average at around 3%

Q6. Were there any unusual spikes or anomalies?
Answer:One unusual spike in CPU usage was observed, reaching at 29% at a specific timestamp.
    No anomalies were spotted in RAM usage.

Q7. Final summary of system performance:
Answer: CPU was at low level during most of the session, with one unsual spike at around 30% during a specific timestamp.
        RAM usage was stable.
        Overall the system was normal with no significant high resource utilization.
